No, I'm not gonna start my first blog with, '*Hey there, Welcome to my blah blah...*', this is going to be more of a personal tracker-cum-blog. 
<br/>
So, the first question, **Why did I start writing blogs?**
The answer is simple (or ig it's not). It all started with a meet with one of the faculty coordinators of the college club I am a part of and the discussion revolved around the fact that the the full-stack development industry is shrinking, especially with the rapid growth of LLMs that can write code in a flash, taking over the need for full-stack developers in the market.
<br/>
***But why did that make me start writing blogs?***

I pondered on it and asked myself, what have I been doing? For the past two years, I've been working on full-stack development projects, learning more about fsd tools and technologies. ***Was all of it a waste of time? Is full-stack actually dead? Is this the full stop to my developer journey?***

Speaking of my developer journey, these blogs are going to be about just that. The knowledge I gain as a developer every day will be a part of what I'll be writing in these blogs. These blogs will help me document my journey and they might even push me to learn something new every day, hopefully helping me answer the questions Iâ€™ve raised above.

**Who?**

Well, I'm Imad, a computer science undergrad at CBIT, Hyderabad. I could've been studying petrochemical engineering at an IIT, but, ig, my love for tech pulled me here (no, it's not the high-paying jobs in the computer science field ðŸ˜­, kind of, but not really). (typing...)
